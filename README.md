# protein-nets

## Project objective
- Create a generalized advesarial network to generate and discriminate between generated proteins based on whether they cut DNA or whether they contain given structural motifs.
- Explore protein encoding (https://github.com/ethanmoyer/ptnstrerrpredict/blob/master/ptn.py)
- Data set is through Protein Data Bank through API calls (https://www.wwpdb.org/)


## Plan for April 5th, 2021
- Introduce GANs (Jeff)
- Introduce protein structure encoding, prediction, mapping (Ethan)
  - Measuring Protein Structure using Machine Learning:
