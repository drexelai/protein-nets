# protein-nets

## Project objective
- Create a generalized advesarial network to generate and discriminate between generated proteins based on whether they cut DNA or whether they contain given structural motifs.
- Explore protein encoding (https://github.com/ethanmoyer/ptnstrerrpredict/blob/master/ptn.py)
- Data set is through Protein Data Bank through API calls (https://www.wwpdb.org/)

## Tasks
[] - Define protein structures of interest, search space, and data base focus
[] - Build database using list of four-letter protein structure IDs
[] - Download proteins from PDB and encode protein structures into grid structure
[] - Determine feature set based on encoding and decide if any more features should be included
